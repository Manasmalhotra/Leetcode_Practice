Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
Output: 4
Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.

Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.


 
 class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLastWord(String s) {
        s=s.trim(); // Removes whitespaces from both the ends of the string.
        String[] ll=s.split(" "); // creates an array of s after splitting
        String temp=ll[ll.length -1]; //Fetched the last word
        return temp.length();
    }
}
